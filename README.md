OgreOculusRender
================

My personal Ogre implementation for the Oculus SDK 0.3.x branch

*LINUX ONLY* At the moment.
*RenderSystem_GL ONLY* At the moment. But I never use directX so I will probably not try to make it work with it.

Also, At the moment you absolutlely need to use my patched version of the SDK due to some stanges bugs : https://github.com/Ybalrid/OculusSDK

That particual OculusSDK works only with that Ogre integration. Changes are verry little (2 lignes added on OculusSDK/LibOVR/Src/CAPI/GL/CAPI_GL_DistortionRenderer.cpp).


Feel free to email me if you have comments.
